  <i><h1>Hurdle Number Three:</h1></i>
  <h2>Those who ignore financial history are condemned to repeat it.</h2>
  <p>There is no greater cause of mischief to the small investor than the confusion
    between the health of the economy and stock returns. It's natural for people to assume that
    when the economy is in good shape, future stock returns will be high, and vice versa.</p>
  <p>The exact opposite is in fact true: market history shows that when there's economic blue sky, future returns are low,
    and when the economy is on the skids, future returns are high; it is a truism in the market that the best fishing is done in the most stormy waters.
    In the late 1990s, for eample, people thought that the Internet would change everythin. It did, but it didn't help the economy that much, and over the next decade stocks suffered not one,
    but two bone-crushing bear markets that resulted in more than a decade of negative real returns.
    By contrast, investors who bought stocks in the depths of the Great Depression (and in the depths of the more recent financial crisis) made out like bandits.</p>
