  understand, will take you fifteen minutes of work per year, outperform 90 percent of finance professionals
  in the long run, and make you a millionaire over time? </p>

  an IRA, or a taxable account (or all three). Put equal amounts of that 15 percent into just three different mutual funds:</p>

  <li>A U.S. total bond market index fund.</li>
