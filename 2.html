  <i><h1>Hurdle Number Two:</h1></i>
  <h2>Finance isn't rocket science, but you'd better understand it clearly.</h2>
  <p> Do you know the difference between a stock and a bond?
    Maybe you do, and maybe you don't, but a little review never hurts.</p>
  <p>Say you're starting a business. It'll be a bit before it starts making money,
    but from day one it'll have expenses, and you'll need money for that up front.</p>
  <p>You can get that money in one of two ways: you can borrow it from relatives, friends, or from a bank,
    or you can sell an ownership interest to a friend or family member. For example, if your brother is half owner,
    he's entitled to half of all of your business's future earnings.</p>
