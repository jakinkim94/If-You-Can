  <h2>Even if you can invest like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=warren+buffett&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjGx_Pt8dLvAhWKd94KHSOcB3gQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=751&bih=566#imgrc=q4oUS3PAG3nWeM" target="blank">Warren Buffett</a>,
    if you can't save, you'll die poor.</h2>

    <p>How much do you need to save? We'll get into deeper math in the net section, but,
    as already mentioned, if you're starting to save at age 25 and want to retire at 65,
    you'll need to put away at least 15% of your salary.</p>

    <p>Before you can save, you'll of course have to get yourself out of debt.
    In thinking about just how to do this, it helps to compare your expected investment
    return with the interest you're paying on your debt.</p>
