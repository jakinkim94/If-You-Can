  <i><h1>Hurdle Number Five</h1></i>
  <h2>The financial services industry wants to make you poor and stupid</h2>
  <p>It's sad but true: by the time you've completed the reading for the previous for hurdles,
    you'll know more about finance than the average stock broker or financial advisor.</p>
  <p>You should avoid them, since their main goal is to ransfer your wealth to them.
    This advice also applies to most mutual fund companies, for the reason mentioned previously:
    they exist to make profits for their owners, not you</p>
  <p>In fact, the prudent investor treats almost the entirety of the financial industry landscape as an urbancombat zone.
    To be avoided at all costs are: <i>any</i> stock broker or "full-service" brokerage firm;
    <i>any</i> newsletter; <i>any</i> advisor who purchases individual securities; <i>any</i> hedge fund.
    <i>Most</i> mutual fund companies spew more toxic waste into the investment environment than a third-world refinery.
    <i>Most</i> financial advisors can't invest their way out of a paper bag.</p>
